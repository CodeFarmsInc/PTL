                         directory OUT

This directory contains correct results for the test programs stored in
directories TTEST and MTEST. The result is always the same. For example,
results of running TTEST\AGGREGAT.CPP and MTEST\AGGREGAT.CPP should both
be identical with AGGREGAT.OUT stored in this directory.
