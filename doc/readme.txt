                     PATTERN TEMPLATE LIBRARY
                ----------------------------------
                         directory DOC

This directory contains the complete documentation of the library
(the User Guide) in the HTML format. You can view the documentation
with Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, or any other 
web browser. Start from file INDEX.HTM
                             ^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the files that form the User Guide (*.htm, *.gif, *.jpg),
this directory includes the following files:

NOTES.TXT contains design notes and technical details that do not belong
          into the User Guide, but may be of interest if you want to know
          how was the library designed and why.

TEST4.CPP, TEST7.CPP are the programs listed in Chap.4 and 7 of the User
          Guide, and are provided here in case you want to experiment 
          with them. Files TT4.bat and TT7.bat will compile the programs,
          OUT4 and OUT7 are their correct results.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you don't have a web browser, find a friend who has it, and print
the User Guide on his/her printer. It is difficult to use a library
like this without the documentation. You can always order the printed
documentation from Code Farms, but printing it yourself will save you
time and money.
