<h2>Chap.1: INSTALLATION </h2>

<hr>

<p>This library comes in full source code, and all you have to do
is to unpack it or copy the directory tree onto your hard disk.
The instructions are provided with the software. </p>

<p>Under the root directory PTL, you will have the following
directories: </p>

<ul>
    <li>LIB ... the library itself, one file *.h for each class
        template.</li>
    <li>ENVIR ... directory which lets you convert the library
        easily to different operating systems and compilers, and
        contains compilation script files for the regression
        tests.</li>
    <li>MGR ... source and executable of the Template Manager,
        and of a special DIFF program which is used in regression
        testing. </li>
    <li>DOC ... the documentation (User Guide) in the HTML
        format. </li>
    <li>TTEST ... regression test suite using plain templates
        (not the Template Manager). </li>
    <li>MTEST ... regression test suite using the Template
        Manager. </li>
    <li>OUT ... correct results for all tests (identical for
        TTEST and MTEST). </li>
</ul>

<p>After you install all the files, recompile the library using
these steps: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Change to directory PTL\ENVIR, and select the batch file
        corresponding to your favorite compiler. For example, for
        Microsoft Visual C++, type <em>msft,</em> or for Borland
        C++ type <em>borland</em>. If there is no batch file for
        your compiler, modify one of these files. </li>
    <li>Change to directory MGR, and type <em>all</em>. This will
        recompile the Template Manager, and a special <em>diff </em>program
        used in the regression tests. </li>
    <li>There is no need to recompile the library itself.
        Directory LIB contains source code for all the templates
        which must be compiled again with each application. </li>
</ol>

<p>All the documentation is in the directory DOC. The
documentation is in HTML format, and you can conveniently browse
through it with any www browser, such as the Netscape Navigator
or the Internet Explorer from Microsoft. Start with the file
GUIDE.HTM. If you don't have a www browser, you can either ask a
friend who has such a browser to print the documentation for you,
or you can purchase the printed User Guide from our company. </p>

<p>Directories TTEST and MTEST contain test programs for all
patterns currently available from the library. These programs can
verify that your installation is complete and correct, but they
are also invaluable as examples and provide guidance when you are
learning how to use a new class. To start a complete regression
test, type <em>regr</em> in either directory. </p>
